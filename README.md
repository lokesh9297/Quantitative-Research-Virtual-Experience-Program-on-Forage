## Task 1: Natural Gas Price Estimation and Extrapolation

- Downloaded and analyzed monthly natural gas price data from October 2020 to September 2024.
- Built an interpolation and extrapolation model to estimate natural gas prices for any given date, including extending one year into the future.
- Visualized price patterns and identified potential seasonal trends.
---

## Task 2: Storage Contract Valuation

- Developed a pricing model for gas storage contracts considering purchase price, selling price, storage fees, injection/withdrawal costs, and transportation charges.
- Calculated the net contract value to assist in trade decision-making.

## Task 3: Personal Loan Default Prediction

- Built a predictive machine learning model using customer attributes to estimate the probability of personal loan defaults.
- Supported the risk team in loss forecasting and capital planning.
- **Output:**  
  - Model Accuracy: **0.9925**
  - Log-Likelihood: **-0.37**

## Task 4: Mortgage Default Prediction Using FICO Scores

- Designed a bucketing methodology to categorize FICO scores into ranges suitable for machine learning models.
- Built a model to predict the probability of mortgage defaults based on FICO score categories.
- **Output:**  
  - Log-Likelihood: **-0.425**
